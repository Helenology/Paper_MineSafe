## Models (for Comparison)

### Part I. Model Information

| Models | Code Source | More Info |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- |
| PCA | Directly use xxx | The very classical PCA method under the $\ell_2$-norm.|
| [RPCA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1970392.1970395) | Codes of the RPCA method are modified from the repository [dganguli/robust-pca](https://github.com/dganguli/robust-pca). **$\ell_1$ norm bug**: see [Error in L1-norm implementation #11](https://github.com/dganguli/robust-pca/issues/11) | **An interesting finding**: I found one typo from the original manuscript of [RPCA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1970392.1970395), whose threshold used in line 3 of Algorithm 1 is $\mu$. This should (or may) be a typo, which should be substituted by $1/\mu$. |
| [CSPCA](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7372472) | <font color=#008000>Codes are written by me because the authors provided no relevant codes (although I tried to search on the Internet as well as email the authors).</font> | **Discoveries & Bugs**: „Äê1„Äë This work claimed to have used [*Fast computation of the L1-principal component of real-valued data*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6855164)'s fast algorithm for solving the $\ell_1$-PCA problem in (9)-(11) on page 353. The problem is that the fast algorithm provided only one (max) PC, while the CSPCA needs $d(\geq 1)$ PCs. Thus, to avoid the above problem, I directly used the RPCA algorithm instead of using the fast algorithm to solve the aforementioned $\ell_1$-PCA problem. „Äê2„Äë No algorithm is proposed by this work. Not to mention how to implement the TV minimization in this work.
| [SSSR](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8485415) | <font color=#008000>Codes are written by me because the authors provided no relevant codes (although I tried to search on the Internet as well as email the authors).</font> | „Äê1„Äë[SLIC](https://github.com/achanta/SLIC) algorithm for superpixels; „Äê2„ÄëFeatures including: [LBP](https://github.com/arsho/local_binary_patterns) (Local Binary Patterns); |
| [PI]() | Original codes in `C` language are provided by the author.| |
