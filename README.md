# A Brief Taste

This repository provides python codes for the working paper ``Detecting Minersâ€™ Unsafe Acts Automatically by Density Estimation and Deep Learning".




## Models (for Comparison)

### Part I. Model Information

| Models | Code Source | More Info |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [RPCA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1970392.1970395) | Codes of the RPCA method are modified from the repository [dganguli/robust-pca](https://github.com/dganguli/robust-pca). **$\ell_1$ norm bug**: see [Error in L1-norm implementation #11](https://github.com/dganguli/robust-pca/issues/11) | **An interesting finding**: I found one typo from the original manuscript of [RPCA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1970392.1970395), whose threshold used in line 3 of Algorithm 1 is $\mu$. This should (or may) be a typo, which should be substitued by $1/\mu$. |
| [CSPCA]() | <font color=#008000>Codes of the CSPCA method are written by me because the authors provided no relevant codes (although I tried to search on the Internet as well as email the authors).</font> | |
| [SSSR](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8485415) | <font color=#008000>Codes of the SSSR method are written by me because the authors provided no relevant codes (although I tried to search on the Internet as well as email the authors).</font> | |
