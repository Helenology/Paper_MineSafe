| [RPCA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1970392.1970395) | Codes of the RPCA method are modified from the repository [dganguli/robust-pca](https://github.com/dganguli/robust-pca). **$\ell_1$ norm bug**: see [Error in L1-norm implementation #11](https://github.com/dganguli/robust-pca/issues/11) | **An interesting finding**: I found one typo from the original manuscript of [RPCA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1970392.1970395), whose threshold used in line 3 of Algorithm 1 is $\mu$. This should (or may) be a typo, which should be substitued by $1/\mu$. |
