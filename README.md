# A Brief Overview

This repository contains Python code for the paper "Doubly Smoothed Density Estimation with Application to Miners‚Äô Unsafe Act Detection."


## üõ† Installation

- Before running the code, please execute the following command in the **parent directory** via the terminal: `sh install.sh`
    > ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Ensure that the versions of `tensorflow_probability` and `tensorflow` are properly matched to avoid compatibility issues.
    `TensorFlow Probability` has strict version requirements for specific `TensorFlow` releases. Please refer to the [official release compatibility table](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/releases) to select the appropriate version of `TensorFlow Probability` or upgrate your `TensorFlow` installation accordingly.


## üìä Part I. Simulation

This section provides reproducible code for Section 2.5 ("A Simulation Study") of the main paper.

### Part I. Model Information

| Models | Code Source | More Info |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [RPCA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1970392.1970395) | Codes of the RPCA method are modified from the repository [dganguli/robust-pca](https://github.com/dganguli/robust-pca). **$\ell_1$ norm bug**: see [Error in L1-norm implementation #11](https://github.com/dganguli/robust-pca/issues/11) | **An interesting finding**: I found one typo from the original manuscript of [RPCA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1970392.1970395), whose threshold used in line 3 of Algorithm 1 is $\mu$. This should (or may) be a typo, which should be substituted by $1/\mu$. |
| [CSPCA](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7372472) | <font color=#008000>Codes are written by me because the authors provided no relevant codes (although I tried to search on the Internet as well as email the authors).</font> | **Discoveries & Bugs**: „Äê1„Äë This work claimed to have used [*Fast computation of the L1-principal component of real-valued data*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6855164)'s fast algorithm for solving the $\ell_1$-PCA problem in (9)-(11) on page 353. The problem is that the fast algorithm provided only one (max) PC, while the CSPCA needs $d(\geq 1)$ PCs. Thus, to avoid the above problem, I directly used the RPCA algorithm instead of using the fast algorithm to solve the aforementioned $\ell_1$-PCA problem. „Äê2„Äë No algorithm is proposed by this work. Not to mention how to implement the TV minimization in this work.
